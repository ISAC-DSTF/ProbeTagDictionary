# ProbeTagDictionary
Standardized Nomenclature for Detection and Visualization Labels Used in Cytometry and Microscopy Imaging

Column Definitions

Probe Tag = Trade name (from vendor)

Preferred Short Name = Recommended standard nomenclature for use by Users and Developers in cases where an abbreviation is required

Tag Type = Fluorescence, isotope (e.g. Cytof reagents), chromogen (e.g. DAB)

CAS#s = Chemical Abstract Service numbers generated solely from the American Chemical Society. Normally  these numbers are unique identifiers for unique non-proprietary chemical structures. However, a significant portion of Probe Tags are proprietary and therefore have no associated chemical structure.

Precipitate Color = Color of the precipitate formed after the enzymatic reaction with the chromogen

Notes = Additonal information relevant to the interpretation of the information provided for the Probe Tagn with the chromogen

Per Policy, only additive changes to the JSON (i.e., new information for new probes or new attributes for existing probes) are allowed. Reshuffling the way information is stored in JSON is not allowed.
