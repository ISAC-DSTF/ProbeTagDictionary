Column Definitions
Probe Tag = trade name (from vendor)
Preferred Short Name = recommended standard nomenclature for use by Users and Developers in cases where an abbreviation is required
Tag Type = fluorescence, isotope (e.g. Cytof reagents), chromogen (e.g. DAB)
CAS#s = Chemical Abstract Service numbers generated solely from the American Chemical Society. Normally  these numbers are unique identifiers for unique non-proprietary chemical structures. However, a significant portion of Probe Tags are proprietary and therefore have no associated chemical structure.
Precipitate Color = color of the precipitate formed after the enzymatic reaction with the chromogen
Notes = additonal information relevant to the interpretation of the information provided for the Probe Tag
